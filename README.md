However, original response was not very good and it wasn't until 1975 that a microwave oven was created for the consumer kitchen.

How Does a Microwave Oven Work?

So how does a microwave oven work? Microwave ovens produce microwave energy (or radio waves), which heats and cooks food. The frequency of the radio wave is about 2,500 megahertz. In this frequency range, radio waves are absorbed by water, fats and sugars and converted into atomic motion, or heat. They also are not absorbed by most plastic, glass and ceramics.

The purpose of microwave ovens is to provide a quick and easy way of heating food. The microwave oven cooks food more quickly than an ordinary oven. It also allows for a greater variety of cooking tasks. For instance, a microwave oven can heat up water, cook a casserole and thaw frozen foods.
